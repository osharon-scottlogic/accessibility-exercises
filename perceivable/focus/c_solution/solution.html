        <h1>Visual Focus - Solution</h1>
        <p>
            Visual Focus is a cue to indicate for the user which part of the application is currently active.
            Below you can find the solution to <a href="../b_exercise/exercise.html">the visual focus exercise</a>.
            Compare your own solution to the one below. There's not always one correct solution, so don't worry if your solution is different.

                <h3 class="task-container">Design Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Adjust the form so that users can easily see which interactive element is in focus. 
                    Make sure the first element of the form is in focus as a default.
                    Users should be able to navigate the form by keyboard.
                </p>
                </ul>
                <h3>Design Specifications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only one element should be in focus at a time</li>
                    <li>All interactive elements should have a focused state (not just inputs, but also buttons, links, etc)</li>
                    <li>Focus should be distinguishable from other states such as hover, visited, or active</li>
                    <li>Focused radio buttons should be easily distinguishable from selected radio buttons</li>
                    <li>Try to avoid changing the layout of the page with focus. Be mindful how the focus change interacts with other elements(e.g. when adding a 2px border the element will be wider than it was before focus, so check that there is enough space)</li>
                    <li>To meet accessibility success criteria outlined in WCAG, ensure that:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            - When the keyboard focus indicator is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component or sub-component, and</li>
                                <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Make sure that there are at least two ways to show focus change, (e.g. a border and a colour change. Color alone is probably not sufficient to show focus.)</li>
                    <li>Consider different variations of background a focused element may appear on (e.g. on dark mode, or high-contrast modes)</li>
                    <li>Ensure visual focus change works for both keyboard focus and mouse focus</li>
                    <li>Invisible elements should generally not be focusable (an exception would be a skip link, for example)</li>
                    <li>Your output should look similar to the following example:</li>
                </ul>
